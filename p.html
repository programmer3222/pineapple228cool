    <h2> <FONT COLOR="red"><u> Paragraph 2 - Why pineapple are healthy </u> </h2>

    <p> <FONT COLOR="blue"> <strong>
        The health benefits of pineapples are numerous and diverse. Pineapples are packed with essential vitamins and minerals, including vitamin C, manganese, and bromelain. Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant that helps boost the immune system and promotes healthy skin. Manganese is important for bone health and plays a role in metabolism. Bromelain, on the other hand, is an enzyme that aids in digestion and has anti-inflammatory properties. Additionally, pineapples are low in calories and high in fiber, making them a great choice for weight management and promoting a healthy digestive system. So, incorporating pineapples into your diet can contribute to overall well-being and support various aspects of your health. </strong>
